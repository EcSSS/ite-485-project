#


# Notes to mention
  *Due the the nature of the timeframe given some decision about the functionality were made in order to make sure the project would be finished in time
  
  *All files uploaded to this system must either be converted to a pdf or image file prior to uploading or the system will not find them when in the upload section. working around this will break the ability to view the file in the system
  
  *Since the entire nature of this project surrounds cloud storage you must have an azure database setup and running and must update the code in order to get the system to work
  
  *Adobe acrobat must be installed on this system and should be installed in this path for it to work without updating the path in the back end "C:\Program Files\Adobe\Acrobat DC\Acrobat\Acrobat.exe"
