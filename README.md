# Criminal Investigation Information Storage System
#
# ITE-485 Project Documentation
* This project is for the ITE-485 end of degree demo class
#



# Notes to mention
  * Due the the nature of the timeframe given, some decision about the functionality were made in order to make sure the project would be finished in time
  
  * All files uploaded to this system must either be converted to a pdf or image file prior to uploading or the system will not find them when in the upload section. Working around this will break the ability to view the file in the system and possibly crash the application
  
  * Since the entire nature of this project surrounds cloud storage you must have an azure database setup and running and must update the sourcecode in order to get the system to work. Documentation on how to change the code to use with your pre existing database will come soon

  * For the current system, all case files that are submitted must not have spaces in the names as the system will crash
  
  
  
  # Installation Notes
  
  * Adobe Acrobat must be installed on the host system and should be installed on this path for it to work without updating the path in the back end "C:\Program Files\Adobe\Acrobat DC\Acrobat\Acrobat.exe"
  
  * Microsoft Word must be installed on the host system in order to open files in the system it should also be installed in this path "C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\root\Office16\WINWORD.EXE".
  
  * Firefox must also be installed to open the image files. It needs to be installed in on this path "C:\Program Files\Mozilla Firefox\firefox.exe".

  * If you dont want to set the installations to these filepaths or dont have the ability ask IT to change the systems source code to your specific file paths for these programs.
